# JMLUnitNG

JMLUnitNG is an automated unit test generation tool for JML-annotated Java code, including code 
using Java 1.5+ features such as generics, enumerated types, and enhanced for loops. Like the 
original JMLUnit, it uses JML assertions as test oracles. It improves upon the original JMLUnit 
by allowing easy customization of data to be used for each method parameter of a class under 
test, as well as by using Java reflection to automatically generate test data of non-primitive 
types. An initial version of JMLUnitNG was introduced at FoVeOOS 2010 in the paper 
JMLUnit: The Next Generation, though some of the information in that paper is now out of date. 

The tests generated by JMLUnitNG use the TestNG unit testing framework, and can be run 
(assuming an appropriately-configured CLASSPATH) by themselves or as part of larger TestNG 
suites. Currently, JMLUnitNG generates tests for OpenJML RAC, JML4 RAC (as compiled by jml4c, 
available from the University of Texas, El Paso) and JML2 RAC (as compiled by jmlc, part of the 
Common JML Tools); since only OpenJML RAC and JML4 RAC support modern Java features, the classes 
under test may not use such features when generating tests for JML2 RAC. 

JMLUnitNG has not been under active development since 2014; however, development will likely
resume in the future.
